Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)  

## 📌 Overview  
This project implements a **Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)** using **machine learning** to identify malicious network traffic. The model analyzes network behavior and classifies potential cyber threats.  

## 🚀 Features  
- **Data Preprocessing** – Cleans and transforms raw network traffic data.  
- **Feature Engineering** – Extracts relevant features for intrusion detection.  
- **Machine Learning Models** – Trains models to classify normal vs. malicious traffic.  
- **Evaluation Metrics** – Uses accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for model assessment.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python** 🐍  
- **Jupyter Notebook** 📒  
- **Pandas, NumPy** – Data handling  
- **Scikit-Learn** – Machine learning models  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – Data visualization
